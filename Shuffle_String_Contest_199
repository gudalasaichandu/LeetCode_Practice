# using enumerate in Python

class Solution(object):
    def restoreString(self, s, indices):
        r = [c for c in s]
        for i, j in enumerate(indices):
            r[j]=s[i]
        return "".join(r)
        
Sample TestCase:
  
Input: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.
